This is Plops, a lightweight, just-the-basics desktop widget engine

To compile you need freepascal 2.4+ and Imlib2 (plus the dev package (libimlib2-dev or similar))

If you have freepascal all set up then ./compile should build everything for you.

There are Lazarus project files for the individual programs in the projectfiles directory.

To try out the widgets, for now just go 

./plops clock battery calculator

Still lacks a bunch of things, Remembering window placement, maganement of depth etc.

The calculater uses  the script 'evaluate' in the calulator diretorcy to do the acutal
calculation .  That just calls wcalc.  you can either have wcalc installed or change the 
script to something else that will do the job  

The battery reads the charge level from a file linked to from within the battery directory.
By default it just links to a file containing the number 42.  
Change the link to point to where the battery level is mapped
something like /sys/class/power supply/etc/whathaveyou

OMGWTF:
I can't see any widgets.

LOLWAT:
They are in front of the desktop, but behind all other windows.   Try minimizing windows.



OMGWTF:
The widgets have window borders

LOLWAT:
There isn't a wiget window type so You have to try for a best fit.
The window type can be set with --windowtype=_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SOMETHING

try _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK, that seems to work for metacity
